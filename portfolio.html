							<h1> Basilisk Game And Process </h1>
							<p> <!-- The "Basilisk" is my fictional snake like chracter, that I have spent majority of my time on during year 12 CDM. Through the next 3 panels you will se how I constructed this idea from nothing to becmoing a full fledged from sketching to colour theory. However I also have a link that holds my SAC Workbook where you are also able to have a closer look at all thee details I cover with my involvment with the Basilisk - link - . This also help me prepare for making and thinking about my next SAC which would contain a small trailer, demonsattoing my character in a video game trailer. -->
							This game will challenge the player to be smart and a bit more tactical at the way they play this game as it is more serious which means the gameplay will be a lot more intense. As Well as this it will have some violent themes that makes this game for a mature age group. The socio-economic background won't be too different to other games in the market accept for the price will be a bit higher due to it being a very demanding game with a AAA studio behind it, otherwise anyone in the age gap that likes game Dark souls/ Demon Souls, Shadow of the colossus, Horizon zero dawn, God of war will definitely enjoy this game also people who are into dark and more intense games will enjoy this more than your average gamer.This game will be sold in local gaming shops around the world and will also be available on console or PC.

							<h1> Basilisk Animation </h1>
							<p> With my video game animation I displayed it through a texture driven animation as I used images and created my own though effects and photoshop, to create a hard and rough look, which represents the Basilisk character. The development for this game animation took just over 2 months, to find different sources and make the best game trailer possible for my audience. Before I created Basilisk I had to think and design a video game trailer through, different design principles to guide me make the best video as possible. As for this process I used a variety of applications in the Adobe Creative Cloud which include: Photoshop, Animate, Illustrator and Premiere, however I also used other sources like Audacity to control the volume.
