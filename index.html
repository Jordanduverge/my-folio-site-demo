							<h1> About Me </h1>
							<p> Greeting my name is Jordan Duverge a passionate game-lover, I have been playing games all my life starting on old gaming consoles like the nintendo 64 and the original xbox, playing old games like kirby, crash bandicoot and the infamous simpsons hit and run. However my flavour for games has expanded since I have been able to grow and experience a variety of gaming which lead me to become an predominantly online gamer. I'm an 18 year old student in year 12, with a  devotion to digital media is immersible as I enjoy working creatively on different projects which help build me a stronger foundation for this industry as I am hoping to study at a University that covers a diverse range of topics that surround digital media. 

							My website that you are now viewing, will show you the previous and current work that I believe to be at a high standard, which is backed up from my dedication to this rising industry. These include my previous models that I created in Maya which then lead me to creating a whole game environment in UE4, which would have to be my proudest creation i have made. Likewise for the last 6 months I have been developing a game Basilisk!
